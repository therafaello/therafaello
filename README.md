<h1 align="center">Hi, Welcome to therafaello's GitHub Profile</h1>

I am a student who enjoys building tools and web applications, especially those that aid administration. Occasionally, I also enjoy forking Minecraft modpacks to experiment with them.

## About Me

I primarily code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with occasional work in Zenscript and SQL.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Szignite**, an all-in-one event coordination tool designed for both attendees and organizers.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about JavaScript.
